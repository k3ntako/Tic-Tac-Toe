# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple command-line tic-tac-toe game built while bored on a flight.

## Play
To run either version, navigate to the directory (either `Attempt_1` or `Attempt_2`) in terminal and run:
```
node index.js
```

When propted, enter two numbers separated by a comma (e.g., 2,2). First number represents the X value, or the column, and the second number represents the Y value, or the row. On a three by three board, `1,3` would represent the bottom left cell, while `3,1` would represent the top right.


## Attempt_1
All the logic is in one file. Not great.

## Attempt_2
This takes the code from `Attempt_1` and breaks it up into two classes. This helps with readability and the scalability of the code.

## Contribute
I would love feedback on how to write better code!
